Introduction
============

The Griffon Legend is an action RPG with screen-to-screen map. It features
original storyline and design made in 16-bit style RPG's of SNES/GENESIS era.

During gameplay you can see up to 3 bars below your character. The top is
health, the next is attack strength (let it charge to hit harder) and then
spell strangth (same as attack). When you learn new spells you will see their
icons in the bottom right corner with a meter below them to show them charging.
When the meter turns orange they are ready for use.

Some history
============

Originally The Griffon Legend was written in FreeBASIC (http://freebasic.net/)
using SDL for graphics and FMOD for sound/music. That restricted the game to
be released for Windows only. Now The Griffon Legend is rewritten in plain C
using SDL and SDL_mixer for better portability, the source code is licensed
under GPL2 license (see COPYING). All non source code assets are licensed under
Creative Commons and are copyright of their respective authors.

The 3DS version uses a fake 3DS SDL layer made by NOP90 and some open source 
libs: ctrulib, citro3d, sf2d, sfil, libnsbmp, stb_vorbis 

3DS controls

PAD  - moving
A    - attack / select
B    - open/close item menu
